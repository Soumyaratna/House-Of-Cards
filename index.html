            <h3>The King</h3>
            The King is the most amazing person I have ever met. He is always my go-to buddy. Whenever and wherever I feel like seeking help, the 
            first name that comes to my mind is the King. He is a hell of a genius and possesses a kind heart and a beautiful soul. May God gift you 
            lots and lots of joy and happiness. He is my best buddy and will be my best buddy, forever and ever and ever.

            <h3>The Queen</h3>
            The Queen and the King, are the perfect match. It's like "the bat and the cat" as if they were meant to be together. Being known both over
            a long period of time, I am totally certain that both the King and Queen will have a great life together. You both mean to me a lot, and I 
            believe, at times when I am feeling low, you both will always by my side. I wish you both the happiest life together.

        <div class="card-text">
            <h3>The Ace</h3>
            One of the greatest assets we both have in our lives is the Ace.  I believe we both can agree that the Ace is the most amazing friend
             we have met in our lives so far. He is one of a kind, and probably the samrtest guy I will ever meet. People like you and me, 
             Ace is a precious friend, and he will be recious through the rest of our lives. And he will surely make a hell lot of money, after 
             all, he is going to start his corporate life through IBM.

            <h3>The Jack</h3>
            Jack, jack is the most recent person I have met, although it's not too late, but still, she is one of a kind. And perhaps I do not 
            know much abou her, as of now, the one thing that I am certain about is she is really good as a friend. And she is probably the closest 
            of all to you. And, coincidently, somehow you both got to work together in same company. I wish I could join you both on the same ship, 
            but as of now, I have to take the small boat. But all the best to her and to you for your voiage over Cognizant.

        <div class="card-text" style="width: 20vw; text-align: center;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 54px;">Two & Three</h3>
            Two and Three are undoubtedly the funniest guy I have ever met. And for you, they are more than your friend, 
            they are your roommates. They are the witness to all your highs and lows. Memories generally fade with time, but when 
            it comes to rommates, their memories lasts till the last breath.

            <h3 style="text-align: right;">The Joker</h3>
            And finally, here I come, the Joker. If maybe not, I want to be the joker of your life, I want to be by your side, every time you are 
            feeling low. A part of me wants that everything should go as it is, you and me would talk hours over phone-call and discuss all sort 
            of things, but thats a fantacy. People should learn to move on, and we should, may be after few months or so, we will not be that much 
            connected as we are now, but somewhere deep inside, we both know, our heart beats for each other. You are the most precious gift that 
            I have recieved through my college life. If I were send back 4 years back where I stand again with the choice between NIT Durgapur and 
            CGEC, damn! I would have, I am not bluffing, I would have choosed CGEC, just for you..!! The moment I lived with you are the most 
            precious gift and I will preserve them forever, within my heart.
